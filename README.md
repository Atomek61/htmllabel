# HtmlLabel
A simple visual label component for the Lazarus-IDE.
It displays HTML/CSS formatted text with help if the HtmlViewer package.

This component is well in use in Delphi, but the integration in Lazarus is not yet tested heavily.
I will use it in the Lazarus ImageResize project.

# Usage
After having installed the package, a new component "HtmlLabel" should appear on the "Additional" page.
Place it on your form and enter some HTML in the "Body" property.
You can put some styles in the "CSS" property to make the text beautiful.

Example for "Body" property: "I think all this ATOMEK stuff is &lt;i&gt;quick&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;dirty&lt;/b&gt;."
Example for "CSS" property: "i {color: red;} b {color: blue;}
